Feature: Merge Article
  As an admin
  I want to merge articles
  To remove redundant content from the site

  Scenario: When articles are merged, the merged article should contain the text of both previous articles.

  Scenario: When articles are merged, the merged article should have one author (either one of the authors of the original article).  

  Scenario: Comments on each of the two original articles need to all carry over and point to the new, merged article.

  Scenario: The title of the new article should be the title from either one of the merged articles.
